<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Section 1</h2>
<p>On a cold day in April of 1984, a man named Winston Smith returns to his home, a dilapidated apartment <br>
    building called Victory Mansions. Thin, frail, and thirty-nine years old, it is painful for him to trudge up the <br>
    stairs because he has a varicose ulcer above his right ankle. The elevator is always out of service so he does <br>
    not try to use it. As he climbs the staircase, he is greeted on each landing by a poster depicting an <br>
    enormous face, underscored by the words “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.”<br>
    <br>
    Winston is an insignificant official in the Party, the totalitarian political regime that rules all of Airstrip One— <br>
    the land that used to be called England—as part of the larger state of Oceania. Though Winston is <br>
    technically a member of the ruling class, his life is still under the Party’s oppressive political control. In his <br>
    apartment, an instrument called a telescreen—which is always on, spouting propaganda, and through which <br>
    the Thought Police are known to monitor the actions of citizens—shows a dreary report about pig iron. <br>
    Winston keeps his back to the screen. From his window he sees the Ministry of Truth, where he works as a <br>
    propaganda officer altering historical records to match the Party’s official version of past events. Winston <br>
    thinks about the other Ministries that exist as part of the Party’s governmental apparatus: the Ministry of <br>
    Peace, which wages war; the Ministry of Plenty, which plans economic shortages; and the dreaded Ministry of Love, <br>
    the center of the Inner Party’s loathsome activities.
